# Build > 02.3 ... MERN Stack

Testing and learning the MERN stack. This version uses a server-client folder pair for production. However, we want to eventually get rid of this in place of Express serving both the backend and frontend of our app.

This will be done in a separate repository for deployment and showcasing.
